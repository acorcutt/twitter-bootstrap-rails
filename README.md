# Twitter Bootstrap for Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline
Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.
It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.

twitter-bootstrap-rails project integrates Bootstrap CSS toolkit for Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline


## Installing Gem
Include Bootstrap in Gemfile;

    gem 'twitter-bootstrap-rails'

or you can install from latest build;

    gem 'twitter-bootstrap-rails', :git => 'http://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails.git'

You can run bundle from command line

    bundle install


## Using with Less

Bootstrap was built with Preboot, an open-source pack of mixins and variables to be used in conjunction with Less,
a CSS preprocessor for faster and easier web development.

## Installing Less

Include Less in Gemfile;
    gem 'less'

Include less-rails in Gemfile;
    gem 'less-rails', :git => 'git://github.com/metaskills/less-rails.git'

## Using stylesheets with Less

You have to require Bootstrap LESS (bootstrap.less) in your application.css

    /*
     *= require bootstrap
    */

    /* Your stylesheets goes here... */

Now, you can override LESS files provided by Twitter Bootstrap

i.e
     @import "bootstrap";

     // Baseline grid
     @basefont:          13px;
     @baseline:          18px;


## Using javascripts

You have to require Bootstrap JS (bootstrap.js) in your application.js

    //= require bootstrap

    $(document).ready(function(){
      /* Your javascripts goes here... */
    });
